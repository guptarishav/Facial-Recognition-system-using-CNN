# Facial-Recognition-system-using-CNN
Facial Recognition system using CNN and opencv.
In this Project there are 3 ipynb files names as Dataset creation,Training model and Test live.
in Dataset creation file i collect data from the user using opencv by using harcascade in this project i take 2 different person faces samples we can take more for that we have to 
change accordingly in training model file.
In training model file i train the model having total 2000 samples using covolutional neural network.
In live file i test the model on a live window the model is showing the name of the person which can be seen on image.

Thanks:)
